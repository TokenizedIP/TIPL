# Why use TIPL?

TIPL adds features and economics to an open source contribution process. When is it useful to add these features?

**TiPL fits on top of open source licensing**. It does not change the open source licensing.  

You can add a TIPL to give yourself some options for handling other IP. Consider TIPL if your project is bigger than just the contributed open source code. It can cover:

* Branding   
* Data and content  
* Internal tools  
* Restricted source licenses that allow contribution and debugging, but reserve commercial rights

Consider TIPL if you want to compensate contributors.

Consider TIPL if your project is expensive. It might require a lot of compute or other resources. Adding some commercial features with TIPL can cover these costs.

Consider TIPL if your project benefits from an option to be acquired. This might be important in the following situations:

* If your project competes with a big model vendor like Anthropic. You are forcing them into a build or buy decision. Your project will be more successful if they have a buy option.  
- If your project is in a category like DeFi that is being invaded by large TradFi companies. Your project will have a bigger impact if they have an option to buy, rather than compete.  
- If your project wants to tap public markets.Some blockchains have set up DATs, which acquire a small percentage of blockchain tokens with public market funding. It is difficult for these minority holdings to earn excess returns. A TIPL makes the entire project, with related IP and operations, eligible for acquisition by a public company or SPAC.

Consider TIPL before launching an AI-themed memecoin. Memecoins have no value for anyone except meme traders. TIPL helps you build IP value for everyone else.

Consider TIPL if you run a crypto project that has a token which has limited value. You can use TIPL to add IP value to an existing token.

Consider TIPL if you want to experiment with automated and AI-managed systems. TIPL does not require a human organizational structure.

## How to use TIPL

Fork an internal project or an existing open source project. We give you skills for adding a token, adding the TIPL license on top of the existing licensing, and managing the flow of contributions.

Build value by attaching proprietary IP to the same token. Include branding, data, and internal apps and tools. You can apply your TIPL to IP that is not shared. You can share IP with usage restrictions.

## If you are forking an existing open source project

If you are forking an existing project from a different maintainer, you can do a few things to be a good collaborator.

* Change the name and the readme to avoid confusion with the source project.  
* Make contributions to the source project. Explain how to contribute to the source project.  
* Add value. Add aggregation, security, specialization, tooling, operation, distribution, and development workflow.
